       <h2>life and legacy</h2>
       <p>  Nelson Mandela (1918â€“2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary,
    political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
    He was the country's first Black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative
    democratic election.</p>
     <p>
    Mandela dedicated his life to fighting racial oppression in South Africa.
    He spent 27 years in prison for his activism and emerged as a global symbol
    of peace, resilience, and forgiveness. His leadership helped unite a divided nation
    and inspired people worldwide to stand for justice and equality.
  </p>
   <p>
    In 1993, Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in dismantling
    apartheid and establishing multiracial elections. His legacy continues to promote
    human rights, compassion, and reconciliation across the world.
